/*!
 * An animated icon that shows the state of the battery. The icon has free
 * dictinct states:
 * (1) Using the battery.
 * (2) Charging the battery.
 * (3) Power save mode.
 * (4) Charging complete
 *
 * The state however is controlled by several attributes:
 * (1) Charging boolean
 * (2) PSM enabled boolean
 * and a slot:
 * (1) Charge complete slot
 *
 * And thus we have four combinations. here is a map that this class implements:
 * 
 * Charg.       PSM.       State
 *   n           n         (1) Using the battery.
 *   n           y         (3) Power save mode.
 *   y           n         (2) Charging the battery.
 *   y           y         (2) Charging the battery.
 *
 * if chargeComplete () slot called, than icon changes to charge complete.
 *
 * This is because indicating the charging is more important than indicating the
 * power save mode, although we could anymate the power save mode icon too.
